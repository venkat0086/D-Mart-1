Project: make a clone of https://www.dmart.in/ site

*DMart is a one-stop supermarket chain that aims to offer customers a wide range of basic home and personal products under one roof  *

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of D-mart Website. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till now in Unit-3 in the masai school. <br><br>

## Technology Stack Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ES6

For storing user data we also used LocalStorage.

## Libraries Used ðŸŒŸ
All the image and icon links have been taken from the main website ( https://www.dmart.in/ )

### End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of javascript & css. This entire journey of has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.

### Limitations:
All pages are very responsive, pages are visible properly on small screen devices also.
